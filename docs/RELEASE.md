# Release and packaging

A release build produces static Linux binaries, Debian packages, and a
checksum file:

```text
dist/deb-s3_linux_amd64
dist/deb-s3_linux_arm64
dist/deb-s3-go_<version>_amd64.deb
dist/deb-s3-go_<version>_arm64.deb
dist/deb-s3-go_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz
dist/deb-s3-go_<version>_linux_arm64.tar.gz
dist/deb-s3-go_<version>_oci.tar
dist/checksums.txt
```

## Building locally

```console
$ mise install
$ VERSION=26.1.1 mise run build:deb
$ cd dist
$ sha256sum --check checksums.txt
```

The binaries are statically linked (`CGO_ENABLED=0`) and cross-compiled for
Linux amd64 and arm64. The version is baked into the binary at build time; a
plain development build reports `devel`. Builds are reproducible: package
timestamps come from `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, defaulting to the current commit
time, so set it explicitly when rebuilding an older release.

The Debian package installs a single file, `/usr/bin/deb-s3`. GnuPG is
recommended rather than required — you only need it if you use `--sign`.

## CI

Every push runs the unit tests (including the race detector), S3
configuration tests, `go vet`, both cross-builds, checksum verification, and
an install test of the amd64 package. Publishing a GitHub release runs the
same build, tests the amd64 package, and attaches the binaries, packages,
standalone binary archives, OCI image archive, and checksum file as release
assets.

Packages are built with [nFPM](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com/docs/configuration/),
whose version is pinned in `mise.toml` so release behavior does not change
silently.
